# 🎨 UI Experiments

A collection of creative **UI/UX experiments** built entirely on mobile using **TrebEdit** and published via **GitHub Pages**.  
This repo is my vibe-coding playground where I explore design trends like **dark mode toggles, neumorphism, glassmorphism, micro-interactions, and more.**

## 🔥 Live Demos
Each experiment will be available on GitHub Pages:

- 🌗 [Dark Mode Toggle](#)  
- 🔲 [Neumorphism Button](#)  
- 🧊 [Glassmorphism Login Form](#)  
- 🎛️ [Animated Switch](#)  
- 🪄 [Hover Effects](#)

(Links will be updated as new experiments are added.)
